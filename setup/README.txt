This directory contains the files needed to create the Redis install
program.

You first need to install InnoSetup (the QuickStart Pack) from:

	http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php#qsp

Then, open the redis.iss file with the Inno Setup Compiler (normally,
you can just double click the .iss file to open it) and click build.
It should create a file named redis-setup.txt with the install
program.
